Compile using 
>make

Install using (as root)
>make install

Note that if your kernel uses symbol versioning, after the new AGPGART module
is intalled, most likely DRM will not load, complaining about missing symbols
since DRM still uses the old agpgart symbols.

To work around this problem, remove the
Module.symvers 
file from the kernel sources. Then recompile and reinstall drm.
