Linux AGP GART


Prerequisites
-------------

If your current kernel has AGP support compiled in (not a module) you'll
need to build a new kernel with modular AGP support first.



Compiling
---------

Compile with:
	make

Install (as root):
	make install


Note that if your kernel uses symbol versioning, after the new AGPGART
module is intalled DRM may not load, complaining about missing symbols
since DRM still uses the old agpgart symbols.

To work around this problem, either:

1. Remove the Module.symvers file from the kernel sources. Then
recompile and reinstall DRM.

or,

2. Append the Module.symvers file generated when compiling linux-agp-compat
to the kernel's Module.symvers file (i.e. "cat Module.symvers
>> /usr/src/kernels/2.6.x/Module.symvers") before rebuilding the DRM.
