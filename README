Linux AGP GART


Prerequisites
-------------

If your current kernel has AGP support compiled in (not a module) you'll
need to build a new kernel with modular AGP support first.



Compiling
---------

Compile with:
	make

Install (as root):
	make install


Note that if your kernel uses symbol versioning, after the new AGPGART
module is intalled, most likely DRM will not load, complaining about
missing symbols since DRM still uses the old agpgart symbols.

To work around this problem, remove the Module.symvers file from the
kernel sources. Then recompile and reinstall drm.
